SUM_R1
ROUND 1 - Add two numbers

Use this small challenge to understand how the system works.

The challenge system is designed to simulate the normal development cycle:
 - you write the code using your laptop and IDE
 - you design your own tests based on the received requirements
 - once ready, you make your software available

When you run "deploy to production", the code will start receiving requests as if they are coming from "real" users.
The code never leaves your laptop, the requests are being sent to your implementation.
At the console you will observe requests being received and responded to.

Your responses are only validated when you type "deploy" on the Server console.
Treat the Server console like your production environment.

For your convenience, a test framework has already been configured for this project.

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     sum(Integer, Integer) -> Integer

Where:
 - param[0] = a positive integer between 0-100
 - param[1] = a positive integer between 0-100
 - @return = an Integer representing the sum of the two numbers
