HLO_R1
ROUND 1 - Hello world

This challenge is part of the warmup and will introduce you to the concept of penalties.

Like this challenge, the official challenge will contain multiple rounds with multiple changing requirements.
The purpose is to solve all the rounds as fast as possible. The timer does not stop between rounds.

Deploying an implementation that is incomplete or has bugs will make your customers very unhappy and you will incur some costs. This is simulated with penalties.
When your implementation fails in production, you will receive a penalty of 10 minutes and some feedback.

Sometimes the requirements are poorly defined. Getting feedback from your users might be the only way to move forward.

The requirement for this round is to say hello to the world. (I know, it's not well defined.)


In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     hello(String) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = a String. Ignore for now.
 - @return = a String containing a message
